# List of custom CA certificates to install on the system
# Each certificate entry requires:
#   - name: Filename for the certificate (must have .crt extension for proper import)
#   - certificate: The PEM-formatted certificate content
#
# Example:
# certificates_ca:
#   - name: sample.crt
#     certificate: |
#       -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
#       [...]
#       -----END CERTIFICATE-----
#
# The .crt extension is mandatory - certificates without this extension will not be imported
# by the system's update-ca-certificates command
certificates_ca: []

# Configuration directory for automatic certificate discovery
# If {{ certificates_configuration_directory }}/certificates/ca exists and contains .crt files,
# they will be automatically copied as CA certificates
